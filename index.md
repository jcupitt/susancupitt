I make stoneware pottery ranging from simple domestic vessels to more
experimental forms. I throw all pots on the wheel but I modify some, at
present creating slanted and tilted vessels with the vertical shifted off
mid-centre. Glazes tend to be muted in colour with some use of wood ash to
create smoky hues, or as an antidote, plain white

The aim is simplicity of effect.

All pots are fired in an electric kiln at 1270 degrees centigrade. Prices
range from £20 to £250, and height of pots from 15 to 50cm (6 to 21"). As
each pot is individually thrown no two will be identical. Please contact
me by email to see what is available. Items can be made on commission.
