### Biography

I have been making pots for over 30 years, working as a member of a pottery
cooperative and attending and teaching ceramics courses. I am a Selected
Member and Secretary of the Anglian Potters. I have been part of Cambridge
Open Studios since 1996.

### About Stoneware Pottery

Stoneware pottery is exceedingly durable. It can safely be used in the oven,
dishwasher or microwave. It is fired at a temperature of 1260 degrees or
more, which is only a little below the temperature of porcelain. At this
heat the clay is vitrified and the glaze merges with the clay body, so that
that pots are non-porous even when unglazed. The high firing temperature
results in a muted colour range but a much enhanced subtlety and depth.

### About Porcelain

Porcelain is noted for its translucency. Otherwise there is not much
difference between it and the smooth white high-fired stoneware clay that I
normally use. But porcelain clay is more expensive than stoneware, is more
difficult to throw, and there are greater problems with firing.
